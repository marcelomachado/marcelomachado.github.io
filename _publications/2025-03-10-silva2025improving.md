The adaptive learning community seeks to provide solutions to customize and enhance students’ learning experiences when accessing web-based learning systems. The adaptation usually occurs from the use of learning materials and user information data, which turns the adaptation process highly dependent on the quality of the repositories. Then, the best adaptation a system may offer might still not satisfy the users’ needs. In this work, we propose an approach to assist teachers and stakeholders in understanding repositories’ characteristics and their gaps according to students’ needs. Our approach, first, selects the best sequence of learning materials for each student, which is a well-known problem called Adaptive Curriculum Sequencing. Then, based on the selected sequences, we use optimization approaches, such as GRASP and Simulated Annealing, to generate new learning materials possibilities that can improve ACS recommendations. This way, our new approach assists teachers in assembling their learning materials. We have evaluated our approach by comparing it to a traditional approach using a real dataset, and the results are promising. In fact, it is possible to design customized materials using a combination of GRASP and brute force algorithms on the characteristics of the learning materials.
