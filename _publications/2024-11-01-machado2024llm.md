title: "LLM Store: Leveraging Large Language Models as Sources of Wikidata-Structured Knowledge"
collection: publications

permalink: /publication/2024-11-01-machado2024llm.md
excerpt: 'Knowledge Integration Framework (KIF) is a Wikidata-based framework for integrating heterogeneous knowledge sources. These can be SPARQL endpoints, SQL endpoints, RDF files, CSV files, etc., and are represented in KIF as knowledge "stores". A KIF store exposes a Wikidata view of the underlying knowledge source by interpreting its content as a set of Wikidata-like statements and allowing it to be queried through a simple but expressive pattern-matching interface. In this paper, we present LLM Store, a KIF store implementation that uses language models (LLMs) as knowledge sources. Instead of consulting a static knowledge base, when queried, the LLM Store uses the underlying LLM to synthesize Wikidata-like statements on-the-fly. The knowledge completion pipeline used by LLM Store can be fully customized and supports strategies that range from simple zero-shot prompts to retrieval-augment generation (RAG). This paper discusses the design and implementation of LLM Store and presents an evaluation using the test and validation datasets of LM-KBC Challenge @ ISWC 2024. We analyze the results of the evaluation in light of the results obtained by our submission to the same challenge, which was based on LLM Store and achieved a macro averaged F1-score of 91%. LLM Store is released as open-source and its code is available at https://github.com/IBM/kif-llm-store.'
